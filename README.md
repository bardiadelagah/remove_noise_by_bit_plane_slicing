# remove_noise_by_bit_plane_slicing

This code show how can reduce the effect of noise in the image by remove some Bit Plane Slicing from image.


## How it works

After we read a photo, we changed it from rgb mode to gray mode. Then we make this photo noisy. Here we have the salt and pepper noise with an impact value of 0.05.
